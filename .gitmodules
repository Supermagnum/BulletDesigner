# Git submodules for BulletDesigner workbench
# 
# This file defines external repositories included as submodules.
# Currently, BulletDesigner is a standalone repository with no submodules.
#
# Format for adding submodules:
# [submodule "submodule_name"]
#     path = path/to/submodule
#     url = https://github.com/username/repository.git
#     branch = main
#
# Example (if external dependencies are needed in the future):
# [submodule "external_library"]
#     path = external_library
#     url = https://github.com/example/external_library.git
#     branch = main
